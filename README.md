# Migration Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model built using Random Forest to predict whether a person will migrate or not based on certain features.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to individuals such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, etc. along with a binary label indicating whether the person migrated or not.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Model Training
The Random Forest model is trained using the RandomForestClassifier from the scikit-learn library. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess how well the model predicts whether a person will migrate or not.

## Future Improvements
- Collecting more diverse and extensive datasets.

- Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to improve model performance.

- Feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model.
